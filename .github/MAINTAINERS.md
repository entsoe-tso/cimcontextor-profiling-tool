# ENTSO-E GitHub repositories maintenance

The ENTSO-E GitHub consists on several project repositories. The CIM Working Group (WG) decided to dispatch the responsibility of such repository between maintainers, either for the content review or to release it. The contact information for our repository is listed below.

### Contributor rights 
Contributors deserve a special mention.

#### Contributor Rights

A Contributor is a contributor with the authority to merge changes into main and other protected branches of a repository. Contributor rights may extend to one or multiple repositories (when existing), depending on the contributor's expertise.

#### Contributor Responsibilities

**Being a Contributor is a significant responsibility.**  
Contributors requesting Contributor rights should keep the following points in mind:  
- **Merge with care:** Code quality should be a priority. If technical debt is introduced, it must be justified and tracked (e.g., via an issue).  
- **Participate in the ENTSO-E community:** Contributors are expected to attend ENTSO-E Network Code Profiles meetings and contribute in their areas of expertise.
- **Be active in the community:** Contributors should be available via email and the repository issues to respond to community questions related to their expertise.

#### Procedure to Request Contributor rights

Please, send an email to the [CIM Working Group](cim@entsoe.eu).

Your email must include a justification, which may be based on:  
- Organisation(s) to which the applicant belongs to and, when applicable, the working group, task force or similar the applicant participates in.
- A list of projects the applicant participates within their company (TSO, RCC, software vendor, etc.).
- Details about the applicant's professional background, areas of expertise, etc.
- The number of contributions in this or other relevant projects.

#### Removal of Contributor Rights

Each year, the CIM Working Group within ENTSO-E will review Contributors' involvement to identify those who are no longer active in the project.  
This review will be followed by a decision on whether to remove rights from specific Contributors for one or more repositories.
