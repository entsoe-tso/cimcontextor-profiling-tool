CimConteXtor is an Enterprise Architect (EA) Add-In.

The main purpose of it is to create a profile in EA with a profile being a subset of an existing Canonical Common Information Model (CIM). 
This sub-setting can be done only according to some rules. CimConteXtor has implemented some rules based on those proposed by UN/CEFACT  Core Component Technical Specification and some of those adopted by IEC  TC 57 (like IEC 62325-450) for the electricity market.
Although originally, CimConteXtor has been developed to build CIM based profiles, it can be used with any Information Model as long as it is available in EA.

“Enterprise Architect” is a tool is developed and distributed by Sparx Systems.
